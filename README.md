#  QA Portfolio – Interactive Test Console #

Welcome to my personal QA portfolio! This project showcases a **live QA Test Console** that simulates real-world testing scenarios directly inside a web portfolio. It’s designed to demonstrate my approach to **automated checks**, **accessibility**, and **continuous quality validation**.

## 🚀 Features

-  Automated UI and DOM checks
-  Continuous background tests (every 10 seconds)
-  Simulated tests for:
  - Broken links
  - ARIA label accessibility
  - Duplicate ID detection
  - Simulated API latency
  - Real bugs.
- 📋 Console output with status indicators (PASS, FAIL, WARN, INFO)
- 🎯 Recruiter-friendly: see testing mindset in action!

🎯 Why This Project?
As a software tester with ISTQB certification and hands-on experience, I wanted to build something:

- Visual and engaging

- Reflecting real QA concerns

- That evolves with my learning in test automation and tooling

- This project combines creativity with quality assurance — and is open to evolution.
