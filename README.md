# 🧪 QA Portfolio – Interactive Test Console

Welcome to my personal QA portfolio! This project showcases a **live QA Test Console** that simulates real-world testing scenarios directly inside a web portfolio. It’s designed to demonstrate my approach to **automated checks**, **accessibility**, and **continuous quality validation**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Continuous background tests (every 10 seconds)
- 🧠 Simulated tests for:
  - Broken links
  - ARIA label accessibility
  - Duplicate ID detection
  - Simulated API latency
  - Critical bug alerts (for realism)
- 🧩 Manual re-run button
- 📋 Console output with status indicators (PASS, FAIL, WARN, INFO)
- 🎯 Recruiter-friendly: see testing mindset in action!

🎯 Why This Project?
As a software tester with ISTQB certification and hands-on experience, I wanted to build something:

Visual and engaging

Reflecting real QA concerns

That evolves with my learning in test automation and tooling

This project combines creativity with quality assurance — and is open to evolution.
